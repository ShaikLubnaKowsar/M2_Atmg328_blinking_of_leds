# OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
I have created a small circuit using the Atmega 328 micro controller.I have sended the Ascii values 0 to 255 so according to that leds are turning on and off.

# INTRODUCTION
Atmega32 is a very popular high performance 8 bit AVR Microcontroller. For this example project we need to use two registers DDR and PORT. DDR stands for Data Direction Register, it determines the direction (Input/Output) of each pins on the microcontroller. HIGH at DDR register makes corresponding pin Output while LOW at DDR register makes corresponding pin Input. PORT register is the output register which determines the status of each pin of a particular port. HIGH at PORT register makes corresponding pin Logic HIGH (5V) while LOW at PORT register makes corresponding pin Logic LOW (0V).

# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES
1.Atmega328 Micro Controller.
2.8-Leds.
3.Relay
4.Buzzer
5.5V DC Power Supply

# ADVANTAGES
1.LEDs are extremely energy efficient and consume up to 90% less power than incandescent bulbs.
2.Long Lifetime. 
3.Rugged.
4.No warm-up period.
5.Environmentally friendly.
6.Controllable.

# DISADVANTAGES
1.Voltage sensitivity.
2.Area light source.
3.High initial price.
4.Temperature dependence
5.Light quality

# OUTCOME
In the simulator I have sended the Ascii values 0 to 255 so according to that leds are turning on and off.The relay gets turned on.Successfully the simulation done.
